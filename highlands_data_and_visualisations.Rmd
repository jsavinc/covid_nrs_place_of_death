## Function to save files to multiple formats

Saving to multiple formats is easy enough - the trouble is with saving PDF files with custom fonts, since they need to be embedded in the .pdf file. This requires:

* telling R where to load the font from, using `extrafont::font_import()` - this was done in a previous step
* registering fonts with R using `extrafont::loadfonts()` - note: this isn't strictly necessary, since once imported, `extrafont` keeps track of fonts to load when the `extrafont` package is loaded
* ~~telling R where the `gs` executable is, i.e. the installation of ghostscript on the current machine~~
* ~~embedding the fonts in the `.pdf` files once they've been written, using `extrafont::embed_fonts()`~~
* instead of manually embedding fonts (which resulted in garbled text on my setup!), just use `device=device_cairo` as an argument to `ggsave()` when saving `.pdf` files and it just works

```{r}
save_output_file <- function(filename, extensions, plot, width, height, units, dpi) {
  
  walk(
    .x = extensions,
    .f = function(ext) {
    # if (tolower(ext)==".pdf") device <- cairo_pdf
    ggsave(filename = paste0(filename, ext), plot = plot, width = width, height = height, units = units, dpi = dpi, device = if (tolower(ext)==".pdf") cairo_pdf else NULL)
    }
  )
}
```

# NHS Highlands / Highland LA data

On 28 September, Michael Loynd of NHS Highland asked for a data excerpt for NHS Highland and North Highland (sic) local authority.

## Cause of death & deprivation

Unfortunately, as of 30 September 2021 these aren't available in combination with HB/LA, so they can't be reported for Highland individually.
